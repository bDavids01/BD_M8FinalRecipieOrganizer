Drain and give it a quick rinse under tap water to stop them sticking together as they sit.\nSaut\u00e9 garlic \u2013 Heat oil in a large deep non-stick skillet or wok over high heat. Add white part of green onions, stir for 20 seconds. Add garlic and stir for 10 seconds or until light golden.\nAdd noodles, sauce \u2013 Add noodles then pour over Sauce. Toss for 1 1/2 minutes. Don\u2019t skimp on this step, the flavour is so much better when the noodles caramelise slightly. If your stove is a bit weak, you might need to go longer!\nGreen onions \u2013 Add green onion and toss until just wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve immediately", "notes": "1. Noodles \u2013 Fresh noodles work best here, medium thickness. I used Shanghai noodles (white, see photo in post). Hokkien or lo mein noodles are also ideal.\nIf using dried noodles (egg noodles, rice noodles, ramen noodles, even spaghetti!) \u2013 use 250g / 8 oz uncooked weight (once cooked, it will be around 700g / 1.2 lb which is the cooked weight of 500g/1 lb fresh noodles).\n2. Soy sauce subs \u2013 Light soy sauce can be substitute with all-purpose soy sauce. Dark soy gives the noodles colour and flavour. It can be substituted for more light soy sauce and will still be tasty, but noodles won\u2019t be as dark and slightly less intense in flavour. See here for more info on different soy types and subs.\n3. Oyster sauce provides flavour and sweetness, don\u2019t skip it. Subs: These days you can get even vegetarian oyster sauce, even at some large grocery stores! Hoisin is an acceptable sub though it adds a five spice flavour (still tasty, just different!)\n4. Mirin \u2013 Substitute with Chinese cooking wine OR dry sherry + 1 tsp white sugar (mirin is sweeter). For non-alcoholic, substitute with 1 tbsp extra oyster sauce.\n5. Leftovers will keep for 4 to 5 days in the fridge. Freezing not recommended.\nTIP: Cooking noodles\nCook the noodles per the packet directions. Some require only soaking, most require boiling. For boiled noodles, start the timer when you first drop the noodles into the boiling water, not from when it comes back up to the boil. Loosen noodles as they cook with tongs or chopsticks. Rinse under cold tap water so they don\u2019t clump into an unworkable block as they cool, and shake off excess water before using."}, {"name": "SPAGHETTI  by Lil\u2019 Luna", "categories": ["Italian", "Main Course"], "ingredients": "1 pound ground beef\n\u25a22 cubes beef bouillion\n\u25a21 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce\n\u25a21 (6-ounce) can tomato paste\n\u25a2black pepper to taste\n\u25a22 cups hot water\n\u25a22 teaspoons sugar white or brown\n\u25a2\u00bd teaspoon dried basil\n\u25a2\u00bd teaspoon dried oregano\n\u25a2dash of garlic\n\u25a216 ounces spaghetti noodles", "instructions": "Brown the ground beef in a large skillet.
